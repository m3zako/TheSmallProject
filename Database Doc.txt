Database developer - Misael Salazar

For our Contact Manager application, we set up a simple relational database on
a DigitalOcean web server. The database contains two tables, one for Users and 
one for Contacts. 

The Users' table stores:
- ID number generated for each user (Primary Key)
- Date that the user's account was created
- Date that the user last logged in
- First name
- Last name
- Login (Username)
- Password (Unhashed for the purposes of this project)

The Contact's table stores:
- ID number generated for each contact (Primary Key)
- Name
- Phone number
- Email
- UserID that associates a users and contacts (Foreign Key)

Each individual user may be related to any number of contacts (ONE user may have
zero, one, two, ... , any whole number of contacts). This is reflected in the
entity-relationship diagram which shows the Users and Contacts tables related by 
the user's ID and corresponding contact's UserID. The diagram shows that one user 
may have zero or many related UserID's in the Contacts table.
